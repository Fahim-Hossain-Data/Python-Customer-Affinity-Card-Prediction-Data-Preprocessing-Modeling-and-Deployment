## 📝 Project Insights & Explanation

### 1. Data Understanding

**1.1 🗂 Metadata Table**  
🟩 The [metadata table](https://github.com/Fahim-Hossain-Data/Python-Customer-Affinity-Card-Prediction-Data-Preprocessing-Modeling-and-Deployment/blob/9e7fdd72f4de9e8744f3ebf71edc78e3f616bfe6/2.%20Meta_Data_Table.pdf) summarizes the characteristics of each attribute. For numeric variables, it includes statistical measures such as maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation, along with histograms to visualize distributions. For categorical variables, the table highlights the mode and bar charts to show category frequencies.

A portion of the metadata table, showing a few representative attributes, is presented below:

**1.2 ⚠️ Missing or Error Data Analysis**   
> ⚠️ **not clean the data** at this stage.

🟩 Missing values and erroneous data were identified in the HOUSEHOLD_SIZE, OCCUPATION, and COMMENTS columns. The figure presents these columns along with the counts of missing and erroneous entries. Additionally, the grand total of missing and erroneous values across these columns is calculated.

### 2. Data Preparation

**2.1 🧹 Remove Irrelevant Variables**  

🟩 The data has 19 columns where CUST-ID is the unique identification for each customer. Thus, CUST-ID has been removed as it is not useful for inferring target variable. 

**2.2 🧼 Data Cleaning:** Justification for each cleaning step (handling missing and erroneous data)

🟩 The cleaning process for HOUSEHOLD_SIZE, OCCUPATION, and COMMENTS columns are descrived below:
- **HOUSEHOLD_SIZE**
Error values such as “9+”, “5-Apr”, and “8-Jun” were identified. The value “9+” is replaced with 9, while invalid entries like “5-Apr” and “8-Jun” are removed.
- **OCCUPATION**
Entries marked as “?” indicate missing occupation data and are removed. This ensures the column contains only valid categorical values, maintaining dataset quality for analysis.
- **COMMENTS**
Null or blank entries are replaced with “No Comment”, explicitly marking missing feedback as a valid category.


The proposed suggestions for handling missing values and error values are presented in the following table

  <br>

After cleaning, the dataset contains **1312** valid rows, with **188** rows removed due to errors or missing values.

### 🔄 Variable Conversion

</div>
  
- Write Python programs for the following conversions:  

  - **2.3 👤 CUST_GENDER → binary:** converted into a binary variable using a **mapping** approach to simplify analysis: F → 0, M → 1.
    
  - **2.4 🌎 COUNTRY_NAME → ordinal numbers:** Encoded as ordinal values based on frequency, where more frequent countries received lower numeric ranks.

  - **2.5 💵 CUST_INCOME_LEVEL → ordinal levels:**  Grouped into ordinal income tiers (1 = Low income, 2 = Middle income, 3 = High income) to preserve income                                                             hierarchy while reducing category complexity.
  
  - **2.6 🎓 EDUCATION → ordinal numbers:** Mapped to ordinal levels based on the U.S. education hierarchy, ranging from preschool to PhD.
    
  - **2.7 💼 OCCUPATION → one-hot encoding:** Applied one-hot encoding to transform categorical occupations into binary indicator variables using get_dummies.

### 3. Data Analysis

**3.1 📊 Correlation Analysis**  

🟩 Correlation of independent variables with target variable is shown in the following figure. Based on the correlation values, the variable YRS_RESIDENCE has the highest correlation with the target variable AFFINITY_CARD, followed by EDUCATION and OCCUPATION.   

<p align="center">

</p>

  
**3.2 📝 Sentiment Analysis**  

🟩 The COMMENTS column was analyzed for sentiment using the TextBlob package. A function classify_sentiment computes the polarity of each comment and classifies it as positive (1), neutral (0), or negative (-1). The results are stored in a new column, SENTIMENT.

The number of comments classified under the SENTIMENT column and the levels (-1, 0, +1) are shown in the following figure

### 4. Data Exploration
A Python program has been developed to display histograms of any processed variable, allowing users to select the variable at runtime. The program runs continuously, providing visual insights until the user chooses to exit.

🟩 The Python program will be developed to visualize the distribution of processed variables ('CUST_GENDER', 'CUST_MARITAL_STATUS', 'COUNTRY_NAME', 'CUST_INCOME_LEVEL', 'EDUCATION', 'OCCUPATION', and 'sentiment') using histograms. In this program, users are allowed to select any one variable at runtime, and its corresponding histogram will be displayed. The program is designed to run continuously in a loop until an explicit exit command is given by the user. This interactive functionality has been implemented to support exploratory data analysis (EDA), where the distribution, spread, and potential outliers of variables can be observed. Such visual analysis is considered essential for understanding the underlying structure of the data during preprocessing and model development stages. 
The user is presented with the interface shown in the following figure, where they can enter a variable name or exit the program.

### 5. Data Mining

**5.1 🏗 Model Building**  
- Kept the **first 100 customer records** as a test set.  
- Used the remaining records to **build a logistic regression model** using the **top 10 relevant independent variables**.  
- Identify the **intercept and coefficients** for each independent variable.

🟩 For this analysis, the first 100 customer records from the processed campaign dataset were set aside for testing, while the remaining data were used to build a logistic regression model. The correlation between each independent variable and the target was calculated, and the top 10 features were selected as predictors. After training, the model’s intercept and coefficients were obtained to assess the direction and magnitude of each feature’s influence.

The intercept value of -1.730 serves as the baseline. Among the top predictors, CUST_GENDER (1.035) has the strongest positive impact, followed by EDUCATION (0.645), OCCUPATION (0.469), YRS_RESIDENCE (0.468), and HOME_THEATER_PACKAGE (0.401). Most features positively influence the outcome, while OS_DOC_SET_KANJI (-0.203) shows a slight negative effect.

The next figure illustrates the intercept and coefficients of the top 10 features.

**5.2 🧪 Model Testing**  
- Test the model on the **first 100 records**.  
- Explain results with **appropriate graphs** and performance metrics.

🟩 The logistic regression model was evaluated using the first 100 customer records reserved for testing. Predictions were compared with actual outcomes, and performance was assessed using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

The model achieved 79% accuracy, correctly predicting 65 non-purchases (true negatives) and 14 purchases (true positives), while misclassifying 16 purchases (false negatives) and 5 non-purchases (false positives). Overall, the model demonstrates good predictive performance.

 The model’s accuracy and confusion matrix are shown in the next figure.

**5.3 💻 Predictive Application**  
An application is implemented using the logistic regression model, featuring a user interface that allows input of customer records via keyboard or file upload, and provides predicted Affinity Card results to the user.

🟩 A predictive application was developed based on the logistic regression model, featuring a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions of affinity card purchases (Figure-5.3.1). Users can enter customer data manually or upload a CSV file.

When entering data manually, the levels of the top 10 independent variables are displayed for selection. After selecting the input values and clicking the ‘Predict’ button, the predicted outcome is displaye (Figure-5.3.2). 
Alternatively, users can upload a CSV file, as illustrated in Figure-5.3.3.

The following figures illustrate the interfaces of the workflow:
